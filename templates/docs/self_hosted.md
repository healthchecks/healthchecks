# Self-Hosted Healthchecks

Healthchecks is open-source, and is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.

As an alternative to using the hosted service at
[https://healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io), you have the option to host a
Healthchecks instance yourself.

The building blocks are:

* Python 3.10+
* Django 5
* PostgreSQL or MySQL

## Setting Up for Development


You can set up a development environment in a Python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
on your local system to develop a new feature, write a new integration
or test a bugfix.

The following instructions assume you are using a Debian-based OS.

* Install dependencies:

        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install -y gcc python3-dev python3-venv

* Prepare directory for project code and virtualenv. Feel free to use a
  different location:

        $ mkdir -p ~/webapps
        $ cd ~/webapps

* Prepare virtual environment
  (with virtualenv you get pip, we'll use it soon to install requirements):

        $ python3 -m venv hc-venv
        $ source hc-venv/bin/activate

* Check out project code:

        $ git clone https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks.git

* Install requirements (Django, ...) into virtualenv:

        $ pip install wheel
        $ pip install -r healthchecks/requirements.txt


* Create database tables and a superuser account:

        $ cd ~/webapps/healthchecks
        $ ./manage.py migrate
        $ ./manage.py createsuperuser

    With the default configuration, Healthchecks stores data in a SQLite file
    `hc.sqlite` in the project directory (`~/webapps/healthchecks/`).

* Run tests:

        $ ./manage.py test

* Run development server:

        $ ./manage.py runserver

* From another shell, run the `sendalerts` management command, responsible for
  sending out notifications:

        $ ./manage.py sendalerts

At this point, the site should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Accessing Administration Panel

Healthchecks comes with Django's administration panel where you can manually
view and modify user accounts, projects, checks, integrations etc. To access it,
if you haven't already, create a superuser account:

    $ ./manage.py createsuperuser

Then, log into the site using the superuser credentials. Once logged in,
click on the "Account" dropdown in top navigation, and select "Site Administration".

## Sending Emails

Healthchecks needs SMTP credentials to be able to send emails:
login links, monitoring notifications, monthly reports.

Specify SMTP credentials using the `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`,
`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_USE_SSL`, and `EMAIL_USE_TLS` environment variables.
Example:

```ini
EMAIL_HOST=my-smtp-server-here.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_HOST_USER=my-username
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=mypassword
EMAIL_USE_SSL = True
EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
```

You can read more about handling outbound email in the Django documentation,
[Sending Email](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/email/) section.

## Receiving Emails

Healthchecks comes with a `smtpd` management command, which starts up an
SMTP listener service. With the command running, you can ping your
checks by sending email messages.

Start the SMTP listener on port 2525:

    $ ./manage.py smtpd --port 2525

Send a test email:

    $ curl --url 'smtp://127.0.0.1:2525' \
        --mail-from 'foo@example.org' \
        --mail-rcpt '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111@my-hc.example.org' \
        -F '='

## Sending Status Notifications

The `sendalerts` management command continuously polls the database for any checks
changing state, and sends out notifications as needed.
When `sendalerts` is not running, the Healthchecks instance will not send out any
alerts.

Within an activated virtualenv, run the `sendalerts` command like so:

    $ ./manage.py sendalerts


In a production setup, make sure the `sendalerts` command can survive
server restarts.

## Database Cleanup {: #database-cleanup }

With time and use, the Healthchecks database will grow in size. You may
decide to prune old data: inactive user accounts, old checks not assigned
to users, and old records of outgoing email messages. There are separate Django
management commands for each task:

Remove old records of sent notifications. For each check, remove notifications that
are older than the oldest stored ping for the corresponding check.

    $ ./manage.py prunenotifications

Remove inactive user accounts:

```bash
$ ./manage.py pruneusers
```

Remove old records from the `api_tokenbucket` table. The TokenBucket
model is used for rate-limiting login attempts and similar operations.
Any records older than one day can be safely removed.

    $ ./manage.py prunetokenbucket

Remove old records from the `api_flip` table. The Flip objects are used to track
status changes of checks, and to calculate downtime statistics month by month.
Flip objects from more than 3 months ago are not used and can be safely removed.

    $ ./manage.py pruneflips

When you first try these commands on your data, it is a good idea to
test them on a copy of your database, and not on the live system.

In a production setup, you will want to run these commands regularly, as well as
have regular, automatic database backups set up.
