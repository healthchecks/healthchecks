# Email

As an alternative to HTTP/HTTPS requests, you can "ping" checks by
sending an emails to special email addresses.

## Use Case: Newsletter Delivery Monitoring

Consider a cron job which runs weekly and sends weekly newsletters
to a list of e-mail addresses. You have already set up a check to get alerted
when your cron job fails to run. But what you ultimately want to check is if
**your emails are getting sent and delivered**.

The solution: set up another check, and add its email address to your list of
recipient email addresses. Set its Period to 1 week. As long as your weekly email
script runs correctly, and there are no email delivery issues,
SITE_NAME will regularly receive an email, and the check and will stay up.
