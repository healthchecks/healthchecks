<h1>Configuring Notifications</h1>
<p>You can set up multiple ways to receive notifications when checks in your account
change state. Doing so is useful for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redundancy in case of notification failures.</strong> Set up notifications using two
different notification channels (for example, email and Slack). If one transport
fails (e.g., an email message goes to spam), you still receive a notification over the
other channel.</li>
<li><strong>Use different notification methods depending on urgency</strong>. For example, if a
low-priority housekeeping script fails, post a message in chat. If a vital service fails,
post in chat, send an email, and send SMS.</li>
<li>Route notifications to the right people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each notification method ("integration") belongs to a project:
if you want to use a notification method in multiple projects, you will need to
set it up in each project separately.</p>
<p>In the web interface, the "Checks" page shows a visual overview of which alerting
methods are active for each check. You can click the icons to toggle them on and off:</p>
<p><img alt="Integration icons in the checks list" src="IMG_URL/checks_integrations.png" /></p>
<p>You can also toggle the integrations by clicking the "ON" / "OFF" labels in
individual check's details pages:</p>

<h2>Integration Setup</h2>
<h3>Slack</h3>
<p>To enable the Slack "self-service" integration, you will need to create a "Slack App".</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a <em>new Slack app</em> on <a href=" https://api.slack.com/apps/">https://api.slack.com/apps/</a></li>
    <li>Add at least <em>one scope</em> in the permissions section to be able to deploy the app in your workspace (By example <code>incoming-webhook</code> for the <code>Bot Token Scopes</code>
        <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps/APP_ID/oauth?">https://api.slack.com/apps/APP_ID/oauth?</a>).</li>
    <li>Add a <em>redirect url</em> in the format <code>SITE_ROOT/integrations/add_slack_btn/</code>.
        For example, if your SITE_ROOT is <code>https://my-hc.example.org</code> then the redirect URL would be
        <code>https://my-hc.example.org/integrations/add_slack_btn/</code>.</li>
    <li>Look up your Slack app for the Client ID and Client Secret at <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps/APP_ID/general?">https://api.slack.com/apps/APP_ID/general?</a> . Put them
        in <code>SLACK_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET</code> environment
        variables.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discord</h3>
<p>To enable Discord integration, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Register a new application on <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me">https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me</a></li>
    <li>add a redirect URI to your Discord application. The URI format is
        <co1de>SITE_ROOT/integrations/add_discord/</code>. For example, if you are running a
        development server on <code>localhost:8000</code> then the redirect URI would be
        <code>http://localhost:8000/integrations/add_discord/</code></li>
    <li>Look up your Discord app's Client ID and Client Secret. Put them
        in <code>DISCORD_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET</code> environment
        variables.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pushover</h3>
<p>Pushover integration works by creating an application on Pushover.net which
    is then subscribed to by Healthchecks users. To enable the Pushover integration, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Register a new application on Pushover via https://pushover.net/apps/build.
    <li>Within the Pushover 'application' configuration, enable subscriptions.
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the subscription type is set to "URL".</li>
        <li>Also make sure the redirect URL is configured to point back to the root of the Healthchecks instance
            (e.g., <code>http://healthchecks.example.com/</code>).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Put the Pushover application API Token and the Pushover subscription URL in
          <code>PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN</code> and <code>PUSHOVER_SUBSCRIPTION_URL</code> environment
          variables. (The Pushover subscription URL should look similar to
          <code>https://pushover.net/subscribe/yourAppName-randomAlphaNumericData</code>.</li>          
</ul>
<p>The registration workflow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On Healthchecks, the user adds a "Pushover" integration to a project</li>
    <li>Healthchecks redirects user's browser to a <a href="http://pushover.net/">Pushover.net</a> subscription page</li>
    <li>User approves adding the Healthchecks subscription to their Pushover account</li>
    <li><a href="http://pushover.net/">Pushover.net</a> HTTP redirects back to Healthchecks with a subscription token</li>
    <li>Healthchecks saves the subscription token and uses it for sending Pushover notifications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signal</h3>
<p>Healthchecks uses <a href="https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli">signal-cli</a> to send Signal
    notifications. Healthcecks interacts with signal-cli over DBus.</p>
<p>To enable the Signal integration:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set up and configure signal-cli to listen on DBus system bus (<a href="https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/DBus-service">instructions</a>).
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you can send test messages from command line, using the `dbus-send` example given in the signal-cli instructions.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Set the <code>SIGNAL_CLI_ENABLED</code> environment variable to <code>True</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Telegram</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Create a Telegram bot by talking to the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather">BotFather</a>. Set the bot's name, description, user picture, and add a "/start" command.</li>
    <li>After creating the bot you will have the bot's name and token. Put them in <code>TELEGRAM_BOT_NAME</code> and <code>TELEGRAM_TOKEN</code> environment variables.</li>
    <li>Run `settelegramwebhook` management command. This command tells Telegram where to forward channel messages by invoking Telegram's <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook">setWebhook</a> API call:</li>
    <pre>
        $ ./manage.py settelegramwebhook
        Done, Telegram's webhook set to: https://my-monitoring-project.com/integrations/telegram/bot/
    </pre>
</ul>
<p>For this to work, your `SITE_ROOT` needs to be correct and use "https://" scheme.</p>

<h3>Apprise</h3>
<p>To enable Apprise integration, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure you have apprise installed in your local environment:</li>
    <pre>pip install apprise</pre>
    <li>Enable the apprise functionality by setting the <code>APPRISE_ENABLED</code> environment variable.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Shell Commands</h3>
<p>The "Shell Commands" integration runs user-defined local shell commands when checks
go up or down. This integration is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting
the `<code>SHELL_ENABLED</code>` environment variable to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Note: be careful when using "Shell Commands" integration, and only enable it when
you fully trust the users of your Healthchecks instance. The commands will be executed
by the <code>manage.py sendalerts</code> process, and will run with the same system permissions as
the <code>sendalerts</code> process.</p>

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>To enable the Matrix integration you will need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Register a bot user (for posting notifications) in your preferred homeserver.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="https://www.matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server-api#login">Login API call</a> to retrieve bot user's access token. You can run it as shown in the documentation, using curl in command shell.</li>
    <li>Set the `MATRIX_` environment variables. Example:
        <pre>
            MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.org
            MATRIX_USER_ID=@mychecks:matrix.org
            MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=[a long string of characters returned by the login call]
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>SMS, WhatsApp, and Phone Call Monthly Quotas</h2>
<p>SITE_NAME sets a quota on the maximum number of SMS, WhatsApp, and phone-call
notifications an account can send per given month. The specific limit depends on the
account's billing plan. The quota automatically resets at the start of each month.
The "unused" sends from one month do not carry over to the next month.</p>
<p>When an account exceeds its monthly limit, SITE_NAME will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a warning email to the account's primary email address</li>
<li>Show a warning message on the <strong>Integrations</strong> page</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repeated Notifications</h2>
<p>If you want to receive repeated notifications for as long as a particular check is
down, you have a few different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use an <strong>incident management system</strong> (PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie,
PagerTree), you can set up escalation rules there.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Pushover</strong> integration with the "Emergency" priority. Pushover will
play a loud notification sound on your phone every 5 minutes until the notification
is acknowledged.</li>
<li>SITE_NAME can send <strong>hourly or daily email reminders</strong> if any check is down
in any of your projects.
Set them up in <a href="../../accounts/profile/notifications/">Account Settings › Email Reports</a>:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Email reminder options" src="IMG_URL/email_reports.png" /></p>
<h2>Monthly Reports</h2>
<p>SITE_NAME sends monthly email reports at the start of each month. Use them
to make sure all checks have their expected state, and nothing has
"fallen through the cracks."</p>
<p>A monthly report shows checks from all your projects.
For each check, it lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>check's current status</li>
<li>the number of downtimes by month, for the last two months</li>
<li>the total downtime duration by month, for the last two months</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Example monthly report" src="IMG_URL/monthly_report.png" /></p>
<p>You can opt-out from the monthly reports in the
<a href="../../accounts/profile/notifications/">Account Settings › Email Reports</a> page
or by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the email report's footer.</p>
