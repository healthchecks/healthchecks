# How to Monitor Systemd Tasks with SITE_NAME

SITE_NAME can monitor your Systemd scheduled tasks and notify you when they don't run
at expected times. Assuming curl or wget is available, you will not need to install
new software on your servers.

SITE_NAME monitoring works by listening for "start" and "success" signals sent as HTTP
requests by the monitored task. When SITE_NAME does not receive the HTTP request at the
expected time, it notifies you. This monitoring technique, also called
"heartbeat monitoring", can detect various failure modes:

* The whole machine goes down (power outage, hardware failure, somebody trips on
  cables, etc.).
* Systemd does not start the task because of an invalid configuration.
* The task exits with a non-zero exit code.
* The task runs at the wrong time or keeps running for an abnormally long time.

Each Systemd scheduled task is defined by two files:

* The `.service` file describes the command to run, the system user to run it as,
  the environment variables to set, and what other services must already be running.
* The `.timer` file contains the task's schedule.

## Using curl

To monitor a task with SITE_NAME, you will need to make changes in the `.service` file.
Let's consider a service "copy-media.service" which copies `/opt/media` directory to a
remote host:

```
[Unit]
Description=Copy /opt/media to remote_host
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=rsync -a /opt/media/ remote_user@remote_host:/opt/media/
```

Here's the same service, extended to send a start signal to SITE_NAME before the
main command runs, and to report the command's exit status to SITE_NAME after it
completes:

```
[Unit]
Description=Copy /opt/media to remote_host, with SITE_NAME monitoring
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStartPre=curl -sS -m 10 --retry 5 PING_URL/start
ExecStart=rsync -a /opt/media/ remote_user@remote_host:/opt/media/
ExecStopPost=curl -sS -m 10 --retry 5 PING_URL/${EXIT_STATUS}
```

The `ExecStartPre` command runs before the main process. The "-" prefix in front of the
command is important and tells Systemd to ignore curl failure (timeout or non-zero exit
status), which could otherwise prevent the main command from running.

The `ExecStopPost` command runs after the main process finishes. Systemd provides an
`$EXIT_STATUS` variable with the exit status of the main process (a 0-255 number).
SITE_NAME will consider exit status 0 as success, and anything above 0 as failure.

curl flags:

* `-sS` means "suppress output except errors". This is so that if the curl call fails,
  the error is printed in system logs.
* `-m <seconds>` is the maximum in seconds that the HTTP request is allowed to take.
* `--retry <num>` is how many times curl will retry transient failures
  (timeouts, HTTP 5xx status codes).

This example only requires curl to be installed on the system but does not capture
the command's output.

in Systemd documentation.

## Using runitor

An alternative is to use [runitor](https://github.com/bdd/runitor) which takes care of
sending the start, success, and failure signals, and also captures and truncates
command's output:

```
[Unit]
Description=Copy /opt/media to remote_host, with runitor
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=runitor -uuid your-uuid-here -- rsync -a /opt/media/ remote_user@remote_host:/opt/media/
```

Of course, the above example relies on the runitor binary being available in the
system PATH.

## OnCalendar Schedules

Inside the `.timer` file, the task's schedule is set using the `OnCalendar` option
which takes a calendar event expression:

```
[Unit]
Description=Run copy-media.service every 4 hours on workdays

[Timer]
OnCalendar=Mon-Fri *-*-* 0/4:00

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

The calendar event expressions are different from cron expressions. SITE_NAME supports
them nativelyâ€“you can specify a check's schedule using
the same expression you use in the `.timer` file:
