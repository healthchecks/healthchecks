<h1>Measuring Script Run Time</h1>
<p>Append <code>/start</code> to a ping URL and use it to signal when a job starts.
 After receiving a start signal, Healthchecks.io will show the check as "Started."
 It will store the "start" events and display the job execution times. SITE_NAME
 calculates the job execution times as the time gaps between adjacent "start" and
 "success" events.</p>
<h2>Alerting Logic</h2>
<p>SITE_NAME applies an additional alerting rule for jobs that  use the <code>/start</code> signal.</p>
<p>If a job sends a "start" signal, but then does not send a "success"
signal within its configured grace time, SITE_NAME will assume the job
has failed. It will mark the job as "down" and send out alerts.</p>
<h2>Usage Example</h2>
<p>Below is a code example in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>
<span class="n">URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;PING_URL&quot;</span>


<span class="c1"># &quot;/start&quot; kicks off a timer: if the job takes longer than</span>
<span class="c1"># the configured grace time, the check will be marked as &quot;down&quot;</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">URL</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/start&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">timeout</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exceptions</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">RequestException</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># If the network request fails for any reason, we don&#39;t want</span>
    <span class="c1"># it to prevent the main job from running</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>


<span class="c1"># TODO: run the job here</span>
<span class="n">fib</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;F(42) = </span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># Signal success:</span>
<span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">URL</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Viewing Measured Run Times</h2>
<p>When SITE_NAME receives a "start" signal followed by a regular ping or a "fail"
signal, and the two events are less than 72 hours apart,
you will see the time delta displayed in the list of checks. If the two events are
more than 72 hours apart, they are assumed to be unrelated, and the time delta is
not displayed.</p>

<p>You can also see durations of the previous runs when viewing an individual check:</p>
