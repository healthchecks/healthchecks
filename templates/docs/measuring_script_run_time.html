<h1>Measuring Script Run Time</h1>
<p>Append <code>/start</code> to a ping URL and use it to signal when a job starts.
 After receiving a start signal, Healthchecks.io will show the check as "Started."
 It will store the "start" events and display the job execution times. SITE_NAME
 calculates the job execution times as the time gaps between adjacent "start" and
 "success" events.</p>
<h2>Alerting Logic</h2>
<p>SITE_NAME applies an additional alerting rule for jobs that  use the <code>/start</code> signal.</p>
<p>If a job sends a "start" signal, but then does not send a "success"
signal within its configured grace time, SITE_NAME will assume the job
has failed. It will mark the job as "down" and send out alerts.</p>
<h2>Usage Example</h2>
<p>Below is a code example in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>
<span class="n">URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;PING_URL&quot;</span>


<span class="c1"># &quot;/start&quot; kicks off a timer: if the job takes longer than</span>
<span class="c1"># the configured grace time, the check will be marked as &quot;down&quot;</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">URL</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/start&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">timeout</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exceptions</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">RequestException</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># If the network request fails for any reason, we don&#39;t want</span>
    <span class="c1"># it to prevent the main job from running</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>


<span class="c1"># TODO: run the job here</span>
<span class="n">fib</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;F(42) = </span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># Signal success:</span>
<span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">URL</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Viewing Measured Run Times</h2>
<p>When SITE_NAME receives a "start" signal followed by a regular ping or a "fail"
signal, and the two events are less than 72 hours apart,
you will see the duration displayed in the list of checks. If the two events are
more than 72 hours apart, they are assumed to be unrelated, and the duration is
not displayed.</p>
<p><img alt="List of checks with durations" src="IMG_URL/checks_durations.png" /></p>
<p>You can also see durations of the previous runs when viewing an individual check:</p>
<p><img alt="Log of received pings with durations" src="IMG_URL/details_durations.png" /></p>
<h2>Specifying Run IDs</h2>
<p>When several instances of the same job can run concurrenlty, the calculated run times
can come out wrong, as SITE_NAME cannot reliably determine which success event
corresponds to which start event. To work around this problem, the client can
optionally specify a run ID in the <code>rid</code> query parameter of any ping URL. When a
success event specifies the <code>rid</code> parameter, SITE_NAME will look for a
start event with a matching <code>rid</code> value when calculating the execution time.</p>
<p>The run IDs must be in a specific format: they must be UUID values in the canonical
textual representation (example: <code>728b3763-ea80-4113-9fc0-f49b3adf226a</code>, note no
curly braces, and no uppercase characters).</p>
<p>The client is free to pick run ID values randomly or use a deterministic process
to generate them. The only thing that matters is that the start and the success
pings of a single job execution use the same run ID value.</p>
<p>Below is an example shell script which generates the run ID using <code>uuidgen</code> and
makes HTTP requests using curl:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span class="nv">RID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>uuidgen<span class="sb">`</span>

<span class="c1"># send a start ping, specify rid parameter:</span>
curl -fsS -m <span class="m">10</span> --retry <span class="m">5</span> PING_URL/start?rid<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$RID</span>

<span class="c1"># ... FIXME: run the job here ...</span>

<span class="c1"># send the success ping, use same rid parameter:</span>
curl -fsS -m <span class="m">10</span> --retry <span class="m">5</span> PING_URL?rid<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$RID</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If client specifies run IDs, SITE_NAME will display them in the "Events"
section in a shortened form:</p>
<p><img alt="Log of received pings with run IDs and durations" src="IMG_URL/run_ids.png" /></p>
<p>Also note how the execution times are available for both "success" events. If the
run IDs were not used in this example, the event #4 would not show an execution time
since it is not preceded by a "start" event.</p>
<h2>Alerting Logic When Using Run IDs</h2>
<p>If a job sends a "start" signal, but then does not send a "success"
signal within its configured grace time, SITE_NAME will assume the job
has failed and notify you. However, when using Run IDs, there is an important
caveat: SITE_NAME <strong>will not monitor the execution times of all
concurrent job runs</strong>, it will only monitor the execution time of the
most recently started run.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let's assume the grace time of 1 minute, and look at the above example
again. The event #4 ran for 6 minutes 39 seconds and so overshot the time budget
of 1 minute. But SITE_NAME generated no alerts because <strong>the most recently started
run completed within the time limit</strong> (it took 37 seconds, which is less than 1 minute).</p>
