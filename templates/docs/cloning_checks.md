# Cloning Checks

You can clone individual checks from the "Check Details"
page:

![The "Create a Copy" button](IMG_URL/create_copy.png)

The "Create a Copy..." function creates a new check in the same project, and copies
over the following:

* Name, tags, description
* Schedule
* Assigned notification methods

The newly created check has a different ping URL and it starts with an empty log.

## Cloning All Checks Into a New Project

It is sometimes useful to clone an entire project. For example, when recreating
an existing deployment in a new region. The SITE_NAME web interface does
not have a function to clone an entire project, but this can be done relatively
easily using the [Management API](../api/) calls. Below is an example using Python
and the requests library:

```python
import requests

API_URL = "SITE_ROOT/api/v1/checks/"
SOURCE_PROJECT_READONLY_KEY = "..."
TARGET_PROJECT_KEY = "..."

r = requests.get(API_URL, headers={"X-Api-Key": SOURCE_PROJECT_READONLY_KEY})
for check in r.json()["checks"]:
    print("Cloning %s" % check["name"])
    requests.post(API_URL, json=check, headers={"X-Api-Key": TARGET_PROJECT_KEY})
```
