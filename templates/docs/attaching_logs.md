# Attaching Logs

SITE_NAME ping endpoints accept HTTP HEAD, GET and POST request methods.

When using HTTP POST, **you can include an arbitrary payload in the request body**.
SITE_NAME will log the first 10 kilobytes (10 000 bytes) of the request body, so that
you can inspect it later.

## Logging Command Output

In this example, we run `certbot renew`, capture its output (both the stdout
and stderr streams), and submit the captured output to SITE_NAME:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

m=$(/usr/bin/certbot renew 2>&1)
curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 --data-raw "$m" PING_URL
```

## In Combination with the `/fail` and `/{exit-status}` Endpoints

We can extend the previous example and signal either success or failure
depending on the exit code:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

m=$(/usr/bin/certbot renew 2>&1)
curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 --data-raw "$m" PING_URL/$?
```

## Using Runitor

[Runitor](https://github.com/bdd/runitor) is a third party utility that runs the
supplied command, captures its output and reports to SITE_NAME.
It also measures the execution time and retries HTTP requests on transient errors.
Best of all, the syntax is simple and clean:

```bash
runitor -uuid your-uuid-here -- /usr/bin/certbot renew
```

## Sending Logs Without Signalling Success or Failure

You may sometimes want to log diagnostic information without altering the check's
current state. SITE_NAME provides the [/log endpoint](../http_api#log-uuid) just for
that. When you send an HTTP POST request to this endpoint, SITE_NAME will log the event
and display it in check's "Events" section, but will keep the check's state unchanged.

## Handling More Than 10KB of Logs

While SITE_NAME can store a small amount of logs in a pinch, it is not specifically
designed for that. If you run into the issue of logs getting cut off, consider
the following options:

* See if the logs can be made less verbose. For example, if you have a batch job
that outputs a line of text per item processed, perhaps it can output a summary with
the totals instead.
* If the important content is usually at the end, submit the **last 10KB** instead
of the first. Here is an example that submits the last 10KB of `dmesg` output:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

m=$(dmesg | tail --bytes=10000)
curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 --data-raw "$m" PING_URL
```

* Finally, if it is critical to capture the entire log output,
consider using a dedicated log aggregation service for capturing the logs.


## Where to See Captured Logs

In the check's details page, Events section, click on individual events to see
full event details, including the captured log information.

body data, exactly as it was submitted to SITE_NAME:
